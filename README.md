In this project I made 3 kinds of stable coins
1. Anchored/pegged to dollar(like USDT USDC), it's relative stable, pricing near $1
2. Algorithmic stable coin, like UST/LUNA, it's totally decentralized but unstable, highly fluctuating
3. Collateral stable coin using ETH/BTC, also Crypto oringinated but more safety
